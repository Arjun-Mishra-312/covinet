## Usage
Run lib/main.dart

## üí°Inspiration
First inspiration was sort of like AirBnb, where people who have Covid look for roommates who also have covid, but then realized people likely won‚Äôt want to live with other covid-positive people
Then turned into an app to network with people around you who have covid, also trade information.
